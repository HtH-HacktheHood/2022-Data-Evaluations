i think pair programming would be better if we had our own zoom rooms, that way the TAs can allow us to go into separate rooms to discuss more one--on-one with our groups, it was difficult to really interact (which is already a given considering the virtual aspect), especially when doing any type of group activity or checking in about smb matters, since theres weekly updates, just making sure those individual zoom links are placed for each TA (one zoom link per TA)

i would also suggest changing the zoom settings to mute upon entry lol

i think it'd be cool (if there's capacity amongst staff) if there were also events outside of regular programming like a virtual ""coffee talk"" with some of the guest speakers, that was more of an informal meeting, so folks don't feel restricted by time or be intimidated by the larger group

lastly, i personally liked the last sociotechnical class, but i do think these kinds of conversations/activities are better fitted into programs/courses where these kinds of conversations are the main focus, i found that a few of my peers found the questions difficult to answer/comprehend and though we've had multiple socio-technical classes, i believe it was still largely new for folks who aren't normally in organizing/community advocacy spaces (esp for the younger folks), perhaps a more introductory activity similar to the one we had in the beginning of class discussing how tech and communities intersect, or even an activity to discuss all the sociotechnical classes we had, and breaking down each class and discussing our thoughts on how that class was or if there was any comments that were left unsaid or ideas that connected with one another.",106,,Unknown,,
